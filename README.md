## About

This list focuses exclusively on **physical hardware testing, biological testing, and industrial certification services**. We cover:

- **Laboratory Testing:** EMC, HPLC, GC-MS, tensile strength, metallurgy, etc.
- **Biological Testing:** Pharmaceutical, biocompatibility, preclinical, biosafety
- **Industrial Testing:** Environmental chambers, HALT/HASS, salt spray, IP ratings
- **Certification:** UL, CE, ISO 17025, A2LA accreditation

**Explicitly Excluded:** Software QA, unit testing frameworks, code coverage tools, and digital security testing.

**Why This Matters:** Finding specialized testing labs is notoriously difficult. Engineers waste days searching for labs certified for specific standards (ISO 19880-3, SAE J2601, UN ECE R134) or capabilities (700 bar pressure, cryogenic hydrogen, -40°C to +85°C thermal cycling). This list aggregates the best providers globally.

**💡 Tip:** Use [TSTR.site](https://tstr.site) to search by exact certification standards (e.g., "ISO 19880-3 valve testing") or technical specifications (e.g., "700 bar pressure capability").

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure your submission meets the following criteria:

### Submission Guidelines

1. **Physical Lab Address Required:** Provider must operate at least one physical testing facility. No pure consulting firms or software tools.
2. **Active Operations:** Lab must be currently operational (check website for recent updates or news).
3. **Niche or Specialized:** Prefer labs with specific certifications (ISO 17025, A2LA), unique capabilities (cryogenic, high pressure), or industry specialization (pharmaceutical, aerospace).
4. **Format:** `[**Lab Name**](URL) - Brief description including key capabilities, certifications, or specializations.`
5. **Pull Request:** Fork this repo, add your entry under the appropriate category, and submit a PR with a clear title (e.g., "Add XYZ Labs - Hydrogen Embrittlement Testing").

### Quality Standards

- **No Duplicates:** Search the list first
- **No Spam:** One entry per provider (don't submit multiple divisions unless they offer distinct services)
- **Accurate Links:** URL must resolve to provider's official website
- **Neutral Tone:** Avoid marketing language like "best," "leading," "world-class" unless objectively verifiable
