## About

This list focuses exclusively on testers persforming **physical hardware testing, biological testing, and industrial certification services**. We cover:

- **Hydrogen & Energy:** High-pressure (700 bar), cryogenic, and fuel cell component validation.
- **Biological Testers:** Pharmaceutical, biocompatibility, preclinical, biosafety.
- **Laboratory Testers:** EMC, HPLC, GC-MS, tensile strength, metallurgy.
- **Industrial Testers:** Environmental chambers, HALT/HASS, salt spray, IP ratings.
- **Certification:** UL, CE, ISO 17025, A2LA accreditation.

**Explicitly Excluded:** Software QA, unit testing frameworks, code coverage tools, and digital security testing.

**Why This Matters:** Finding specialized testing labs is notoriously difficult. Engineers waste days searching for labs certified for specific standards (e.g., **ISO 19880-3**, **SAE J2601**) or capabilities (cryogenic hydrogen, -40°C to +85°C thermal cycling). This list aggregates the best providers globally.
